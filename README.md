# USTSim
Happy little reverse engineering RPG simulation challenge for the HKUST Firebird 2023 Internal CTF.

The challenge is meant to be closed-source, i.e. the contestant can find the flag from the binary and doesn't have access to the C++ source code. You can find this binary in [`chal/`](chal/). For posterity, I've uploaded the source files.

Features coloured terminal output, interactive commands (plus some secret commands!), and whatnot.

Might add NPCs and other events in the future, perhaps for another CTF challenge. :)
